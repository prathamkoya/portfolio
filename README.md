# Pratham Koya 🌟

## Welcome! 👋🎉

I'm Pratham Koya, a final-year Computer Science student 🎓 at Sheridan College, where I specialize in Mobile Computing 📱 and Machine Learning 🤖. My journey in tech has led me to collaborate with organizations like Naryant and Osteoporosis Canada, working on groundbreaking research that leverages data science to tackle healthcare challenges 💡.

### 📚 Education

- **Bachelor in Computer Science (Mobile-Computing)**, Sheridan College, Expected Dec 2024 🗓️
- **Advanced Diploma in Computer Engineering Technology**, L.J Polytechnic, GPA: 3.8/4.0 🏅

### 💼 Professional Experience

- **Machine Learning Data Scientist (Co-op)**, Sheridan College + Naryant, Sep 2023 – Present 🧠
  ## Work
    - As a Machine Learning Data Scientist Intern at Sheridan's Centre for Applied AI (CAAI), I collaborate
      with Osteoporosis Canada and Naryant to build data cleaning, data exploration, prediction and feature engineering
      scripts using Python on the Osteoporosis Patient database to find actionable insights and predictions for Osteoprosis 
      patients.
    - This huge dataset/database has patient data which has been collected from the public hospitals in Ontario.
      As this data is very private and secure we execue our scripts using a data pipeline.
    - Our Research poster will be presented in _**International Conference on Aging Innovation (ICAIR)**_ in Toronto by director
      of Osteoporosis Canada.
  
  ## Achievements
    - Improved data processing speed by 300% through parallel processing ⚡.
    - Set up a secure data pipeline, enhancing efficiency by 40% for over 30,000 patient records 📈.


- **Machine Learning Researcher (Co-op)**, Sheridan College + Naryant, May 2023 – Sep 2023 🔍
  ## Work
    - As a Machine Learning Research Intern at Sheridan's Centre for Applied AI (CAAI) I researched on Osteoprosis 
      Patient's long term Fracture risk. As a research intern I have built Machine learning models to classify
      the risk of patients experiencing their Osteoprosis Fracture in long-term. I also helped building a risk-calculator
      that uses this model's prediction output.

  ## Achievement
    - Enhanced FRAX fracture risk tool's efficiency by 200% using machine learning models 📊.
    - Achieved a 92% predictive accuracy in osteoporosis research with Random Forest analysis 🌳.


- **iOS Application Developer Mentor**, Career Education Council, Jan 2023 – Jun 2023 📱
  ## Work
    - As an IOS application developer Mentor partnered by with Apple Canada. I taught and supported high-school
      students to learn their first programming language which was "Swift". I helped them getting comfortable with Xcode
      enviornment to build IOS application. Also, went through the ios application development lifecycle to help students build
      and present their IOS application.
  
  ## Achievement
    - Mentored over 40 students in Swift programming in collaboration with Apple Canada 🍏.
    - Led Swift coding mentorship, enhancing student creativity and technical proficiency 🌈.

### 🚀 Projects

- **MoneyExcel - A Simple Money Manager**: An Android expense tracker that achieved over 1000 downloads and a consistent 5-star rating on the Play Store 🌟.
- **FullStack Image Search Engine**: Developed using Node.js and Weavite Vector Database for precise image vector conversion, enhancing user search experience 🔎.
- **Livebox - Video Calling and Chatting Flutter App**: A Flutter app that supports up to 100 users in a video call, built using Jitsi Meet API 📹.

### 🌱 Professional Interests & Future Goals

I am a Machine Learning enthusiast who is always eager to learn new skills and apply them to real-world problems. My main areas of interest are Deep Learning, especially designing and optimizing neural network architectures such as DNN, CNN, RNN and transformer models. I also have experience in deploying and scaling Machine Learning models for production environments. My goal is to pursue a career in Machine Learning where I can contribute to cutting-edge research and innovation, and make a positive impact on society.

I am also passionate about Software Engineering, as I enjoy developing, testing, and maintaining software applications that can solve real-world problems. I have experience in using various programming languages, frameworks, and tools such as C++, Java, Python, C#, Swift, and SQL. I also have knowledge of Firebase platforms, which enable me to build and host web and mobile applications. I am always keen to learn new technologies and best practices in Software Engineering. My interest in Software Engineering complements my Machine Learning skills, as I can build end-to-end solutions that leverage both domains.
